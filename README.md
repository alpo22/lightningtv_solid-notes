Notes on using @lightningtv/solid

First I created an LLM using Google's NotebookLM, and pasted in the following resources:

- https://javascript.plainenglish.io/lightning-3-the-basics-of-solidjs-e6e21d73205e
- https://lightning-tv.github.io/solid/#/
- https://www.youtube.com/@LightningTVSolidJS

Then I asked it to create notes for "View", "Text" and using "Focus".

Using that LLM could also be good for asking/answering questions.
